In this repsitory, you have access to the battlship game that I developped using C language.

# Area for improvement

- Comment the code more:
Make sure to add descriptive comments for each function, method, and code section. Explain the purpose of each line of code, the algorithms used, and any complex logic. This will facilitate the understanding of your code by both yourself and other developers.

- Manual placement of ships:
Add a feature that allows players to manually place their ships on the grid. You can ask players to specify the starting and ending coordinates for each ship, and ensure that the placement is valid.

- Player 1 vs. Player 2:
Divide the game into two separate parts for each player. Each player should have their own grid and their own ships to place. Make sure that players do not see the opponent's grid.

- Sinking ships:
Add logic to handle shots and the destruction of ships. When a shot hits a ship, mark the square as hit. When all squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk.

- End of the game:
Implement logic to detect the end of the game. The game can end when all of a player's ships have been sunk. Announce the winner and conclude the game appropriately.
